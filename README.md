### Hello | Hola | Hallo | Salut

I'm Lucas [aka [@vogelino](https://github.com/vogelino)], a half Swiss half Chilean interface designer and software developer.

I grew up in Switzerland, I speak French, Spanish, German and English and I live since 10 years in Berlin, where I studied Interface Design and worked in a few [software](https://www.ubermetrics-technologies.com/) [companies](https://www.nexenio.com/). Currently, I work as Creative Technologist ( ðŸ˜Ž ) at [@technologiestiftung](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/), where we develop web prototypes for Berlin's public sector and its citizens. On the side, I also take on a few freelance jobs, mostly website design, and development.

My primary skills and interests lie in Frontend Development and UI / UX design, but I am more of a curious generalist. Understanding how things work, why they do, and where the beauty in them lies is essential to me. It is what gives my job a sense and keeps me curious. Unconventional yet intuitive interfaces, innovative yet meaningful interactions, immersive yet well-balanced storytelling, and creative yet genuine aesthetics are among the things that I strive to achieve in my projects.

Nice people and cool projects always get my attention, so get in touch!
